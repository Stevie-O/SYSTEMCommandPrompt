# SYSTEMCommandPrompt
Quick-and-dirty command prompt, running as the SYSTEM user.

There's a trick for this using [PsExec](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/psexec.aspx).
However, I've been having trouble, because PsExec has begun to be flagged as a hacking tool by various anti-malware programs.
So, I wrote this tool, and I put it here so that it might help somebody else.
